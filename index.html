                           <h2>Nine Arch <span class="blu">Bridge</span></h2>
                           <p>The bridge was designed to accommodate a challenging nine-degree curve and steep gradient. Built entirely by local labor under British supervision, the construction faced significant logistical challenges, including difficult terrain and material transport. Completed in 1919, the bridge has since stood resilient, showcasing innovative engineering solutions such as concrete cornice blocks for arch support and locally produced sand-cement blocks for facing.[6]

Location
It is located in Demodara, between Ella and Demodara railway stations. The surrounding area has seen a steady increase of tourism due to the bridge's architectural ingenuity and the profuse greenery in the nearby hillsides.[5]

History
The work had been carried by Harold Cuthbert Marwood as Engineer in charge of that section of the railway, under the approval of the Chief Construction Engineer, Railway Extensions, M. Cole Bowen.[6]

The chief designer and project manager of the 'Upcountry Railway Line of Ceylon' project was D. J. Wimalasurendra, a distinguished Ceylonese engineer and inventor. The designer of the viaduct was Harold Cuthbert Marwood of Railway Construction Department of Ceylon Government Railway. The 1923 report "Construction of a Concrete Railway Viaduct in Ceylon", published by the Engineering Association of Ceylon, has details of all the records including the plans and drawings. [7]

Folklore generally attributed the construction of the bridge to a local Ceylonese builder, P. K. Appuhami, in consultation with British engineers.[8][9][10] There is no documented evidence to support the involvement of Appuhami in the bridge’s construction, but the folklore remains a part of the local heritage.[6]

At the time of construction, which coincided with the commencement of World War I, rumours were that the steel assigned for the bridge were reallocated to British war related projects, and as a result, work came to a standstill, leading the locals to build the bridge with stone bricks and cement, but without steel, except of course for the rails and pins securing them</p>

                           <p>Perched on a slab of rock that juts dramatically over the forests of central Sri Lanka, Sigiriya is as imposing a sight now as it must have been when it was first built by a fierce king in the fifth century A.D. Meaning “lion’s rock,” Sigiriya (designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982) is accessed by way of passageways cut into the rock face between a monumental pair of lion paws.

The fortress was later swallowed by the forest, and only familiar to local villagers. Outsiders used knowledge of its past, preserved in Buddhist texts, to search for the ancient site. British historians rediscovered its astonishing buildings and frescoes in the 19th century.

Kingdom to colony
Sigiriya was built by the fifth-century king Kashyapa I, who ruled the native Sinhalese dynasty, the Moriya. The imposing fortress was the capital of the Sinhalese kingdom until Kashyapa was defeated in A.D. 495. (Watch: An ancient palatial fortress overlooks this barren desert in Israel.)

After Kashyapa, dynasties rose and fell, their fortunes shaped by internal power struggles and conflicts between native Sinhalese and outside invaders from India.</p>

The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an important pilgrimage destination for Buddhists worldwide.

The Sacred Tooth Relic is believed to have been brought to Sri Lanka in the 4th century CE by Princess Hemamala and Prince Dantha from India, hidden in the princess's hair.
The relic has been housed in several locations in Sri Lanka over the centuries, but it was permanently enshrined in Kandy during the reign of King Vimaladharmasuriya I (1592–1604).
The temple itself was built within the Royal Palace complex, signifying its close connection to the ruling monarchy.
The Sacred Tooth Relic:
The Tooth Relic is not directly displayed to the public. Instead, it is kept in a golden casket placed within a stupa-like structure inside the temple.
Devotees and tourists can view the casket during special rituals and ceremonies.

During these rituals, monks chant, and offerings like flowers, incense, and food are presented to the relic.

The festival features a procession of the Sacred Tooth Relic (a replica is paraded) accompanied by traditional drummers, dancers, and beautifully decorated elephants.
The event symbolizes a blend of Buddhist and Hindu cultural elements.

                           <p>The bridge was designed to accommodate a challenging nine-degree curve and steep gradient. Built entirely by local labor under British supervision, the construction faced significant logistical challenges, including difficult terrain and material transport. Completed in 1919, the bridge has since stood resilient, showcasing innovative engineering solutions such as concrete cornice blocks for arch support and locally produced sand-cement blocks for facing.[6]

Location
It is located in Demodara, between Ella and Demodara railway stations. The surrounding area has seen a steady increase of tourism due to the bridge's architectural ingenuity and the profuse greenery in the nearby hillsides.[5]

History
The work had been carried by Harold Cuthbert Marwood as Engineer in charge of that section of the railway, under the approval of the Chief Construction Engineer, Railway Extensions, M. Cole Bowen.[6]

The chief designer and project manager of the 'Upcountry Railway Line of Ceylon' project was D. J. Wimalasurendra, a distinguished Ceylonese engineer and inventor. The designer of the viaduct was Harold Cuthbert Marwood of Railway Construction Department of Ceylon Government Railway. The 1923 report "Construction of a Concrete Railway Viaduct in Ceylon", published by the Engineering Association of Ceylon, has details of all the records including the plans and drawings. [7]

Folklore generally attributed the construction of the bridge to a local Ceylonese builder, P. K. Appuhami, in consultation with British engineers.[8][9][10] There is no documented evidence to support the involvement of Appuhami in the bridge’s construction, but the folklore remains a part of the local heritage.[6]

At the time of construction, which coincided with the commencement of World War I, rumours were that the steel assigned for the bridge were reallocated to British war related projects, and as a result, work came to a standstill, leading the locals to build the bridge with stone bricks and cement, but without steel, except of course for the rails and pins securing them</p>
